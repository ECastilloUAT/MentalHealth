                <h2>What is Mental Health</h2>

                <h3>Mental Health: a personâ€™s condition with regard to their psychological and emotional well-being.</h3>
                
                <p>
                It affects how we think, feel, and act, and plays a crucial role in our overall well-being. Mental health is not just the absence of mental illness, but also involves how we manage stress, relate to others, and make decisions. 
                Just like physical health, mental health is an ongoing process that can fluctuate over time.
